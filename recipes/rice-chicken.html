                <li>Your preferred variety of rice</li>
                <li>Water or broth</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Oil</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Steps for chicken</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken pieces with salt. In a large pot or deep skillet with a little oil, sear the chicken on all sides until golden brown. Remove and set aside</li>
        <li>In the same pan, add more oil if necessary and sauté the chopped onion and garlic until translucent</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and carrots (and any other vegetables you want to add to the sauce). Cook for a few minutes until the tomatoes soften and form a base sauce.</li>
        <li>Return the chicken to the pot. Pour in enough chicken broth or water to cover it.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until the chicken is tender and cooked through (approximately 30-45 minutes, depending on the pieces). Adjust the salt in the sauce.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Steps for Rice</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice if desired until the water runs clear.</li>
        <li>Heat a little oil in a rice pot. Add the rice and toast it lightly (sauté) for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the water or broth (usually 2 parts liquid to 1 part rice; check the instructions for your variety). Add salt</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pot tightly, and cook without uncovering for the recommended time (usually 15-20 minutes).</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, let stand covered for 5-10 minutes, then fluff the rice with a fork before serving alongside the chicken.</li>
    </ol>
